    * Fast compiles and low memory use
    * Expressive diagnostics (examples)
    * GCC compatibility
 .
 Utility and Applications:
 .
    * Modular library based architecture
    * Support diverse clients (refactoring, static analysis, code
      generation, etc)
    * Allow tight integration with IDEs
    * Use the LLVM 'BSD' License
 .
 Internal Design and Implementation:
 .
    * A real-world, production quality compiler
    * A simple and hackable code base
    * A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++, and Objective C++
    * Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their variants

Package: compiler-rt
Architecture: amd64 i386
Replaces: libclang-dev
Section: libdevel
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, python
Description: Runtime C library - LLVM based
 The compiler-rt project is a simple library that provides an implementation of
 the low-level target-specific hooks required by code generation and other
 runtime components. For example, when compiling for a 32-bit target,
 converting a double to a 64-bit unsigned integer is compiling into a runtime
 call to the "__fixunsdfdi" function. The compiler-rt library provides
 optimized implementations of this and other low-level routines.
 .
 The current feature set of compiler-rt is:
 .
    * Full support for the libgcc interfaces on supported targets.
    * High performance hand tuned implementations of commonly used functions
      like __floatundidf in assembly that are dramatically faster than the
      libgcc implementations.
 .
