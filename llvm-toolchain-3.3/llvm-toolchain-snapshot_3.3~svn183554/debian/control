Package: clang-format-3.3
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, python
Description: Tool to format C/C++/Obj-C code
 Clang-format is both a library and a stand-alone tool with the goal of
 automatically reformatting C++ sources files according to configurable
 style guides. To do so, clang-format uses Clang's Lexer to transform an
 input file into a token stream and then changes all the whitespace around
 those tokens. The goal is for clang-format to both serve both as a user
 tool (ideally with powerful IDE integrations) and part of other
 refactoring tools, e.g. to do a reformatting of all the lines changed
 during a renaming.
 .
 This package also provides vim and emacs plugins.

Package: cpp11-migrate-3.3
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Tool to convert C++98 and C++03 code to C++11
 The purpose of the C++11 Migrator is to do source-to-source translation to
 migrate existing C++ code to use C++11 features to enhance
 maintainability, readability, runtime performance, and compile-time
 performance. Development is still early and transforms fall mostly into
 the first two categories. The migrator is based on Clang's LibTooling and
 the AST Matching library.

Description: Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)
 The Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a collection of libraries and
 tools that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time
 code generators, and many other compiler-related programs. LLVM
 uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker), 
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC, or it can emit C code.
 .
 LLVM is the key component of the clang compiler and the gcc plugin called
 dragonegg.
